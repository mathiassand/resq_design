## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cohort_df[cohort_df$DTNMean < 200 & cohort_df$year>=2016,], aes(x = year, y = DTNMean)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = factor(hospital)), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(~ firstYear + lastYear) + 
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_grey(start = 0.5, end=0.5)


ggplot(rsqh[rsqh$DTNMedian<250 & rsqh$DTNMean < 200 & rsqh$year>=2016,], aes(x = year, y = DTNMean)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = factor(hospital)), show.legend = FALSE) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  scale_color_grey(start = 0.5, end=0.5)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
